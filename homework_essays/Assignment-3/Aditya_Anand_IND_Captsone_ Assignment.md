# Individual Capstone Assessment – Part #2

For my senior design project, I am working on **NARLA: an AI-Driven Apartment Co-Pilot**. The goal of this project is to make living with roommates simpler and less stressful by using technology to manage groceries, chores, and bills in one place. Instead of relying on sticky notes or scattered group chats, NARLA gives apartment groups a shared dashboard with reminders, predictive alerts, and bill-splitting features. From my perspective as a computer science student, this project is exciting because it combines areas I have studied and worked with such as databases, app development, and artificial intelligence into a practical solution for a problem students face every day.  

My coursework at the University of Cincinnati has prepared me with the foundation to take on this project. In **Data Structures** and **Database Design**, I learned how to organize and query data efficiently, which directly applies to building features like the grocery tracker and bill manager. In **Computer Networks**, I gained a better understanding of client-server communication, which will help when setting up the backend and mobile app to work seamlessly together. Courses like **Artificial Intelligence** introduced me to the basics of machine learning, which will come into play as we design the predictive alerts for low-stock items. On the non-technical side, classes like **Public Speaking** have helped me grow as a communicator, which is just as important when collaborating on a long-term project and presenting progress to an audience.  

Outside the classroom, my co-op and work experiences have given me skills that will guide how I approach building NARLA. At **CHL Softech**, I worked on software development tasks that sharpened my ability to write clean, maintainable code and debug complex problems. At **QC Consulting**, I focused on building technical solutions like RFID-based time and attendance systems, where I worked with Python, SQL, APIs, and Flask applications. That experience taught me how to integrate multiple technologies and think through real-world use cases, both of which are essential for a project like NARLA. As a **student worker in UC Housing**, I also saw firsthand the kinds of challenges students face when living together, from managing shared responsibilities to resolving miscommunications. That perspective makes me even more motivated to design an app that could reduce those everyday tensions and improve the student living experience.  

My motivation for this project comes from the fact that I have experienced these apartment challenges myself, and I have seen them affect others through my Housing job as well. Students often struggle with things like splitting bills fairly, deciding whose turn it is to take out the trash, or figuring out who bought groceries last. These might seem like small issues, but they can build up and cause frustration. I am excited about this project because it is not just about building something technically impressive, it is about solving a problem I know is real and relevant. That connection makes me more invested in seeing the project succeed.  

Our approach will be to first focus on building the app’s core features with a strong backend using Python and SQL, and then add the AI and more advanced features like receipt scanning. If time allows, we plan to extend it with a hardware demo using a Raspberry Pi and weight sensors for groceries. By the end, I expect us to have an app that feels polished and useful for everyday student life. I will evaluate my own contributions by asking if the features I built work reliably, if they integrate smoothly with the rest of the app, and if I would personally use them in my own apartment. If the answer to all three is yes, I will know that I have done my job well.
