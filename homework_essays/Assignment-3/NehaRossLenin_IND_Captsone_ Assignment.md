# Part #2: Individual Capstone Assessment

I am very excited about our senior design project, and it is to create a mobile application to make life easier in a shared apartment. From my perspective, this is the perfect project as it combines creativity and real technical competency. My favorite part is applying what I have learned about SQL and Python programming. With SQL programming, I will establish and coordinate the database containing important information like groceries, payments, and chores, while Python programming will bring together logic and the app features of automated actions. It will be wonderful to watch these pieces come together in an operational system that really solves a problem students face on a daily basis. As an entire effort, this project feels like the perfect time to bring to life what I have learned in class and bring it to tangible and effective life.

My undergraduate courses have given me a solid foundation to directly apply to our senior design. Courses like CS4092: Database Design and Development have been the best in preparing me to tackle the SQL portions of the app since I learned through hands-on how to design ER models and construct relational databases. CS2023: Python Programming was an earlier course I completed, and while it was a simple introduction, it gave me essential practice using Pandas and using code in Python. I also reaped the benefits of EECE3093C: Software Engineering where I worked on group projects and how to approach software developmental processes methodically and in groups. EECE4029: Operating Systems and Systems Programming taught me considerations towards being efficient, towards allocating resources well, and towards debugging and these I will be in a position to apply while making certain the app runs efficiently. Lastly, CS4033: Artificial Intelligence equipped me to be in a position to add to the predictive algorithms to make our app stand out. As a combination, these courses gave me both problem-solving and technical skills to now apply towards developing NARLA.

My co-operative and professional experiences have even shaped how I will approach this project even though the labor itself wasn't technical. At UC Parking Services, where I currently serve as a Lead Student Worker, I have been able to oversee student workers, troubleshoot technical issues with parking equipment, and work with vast amounts of data in Excel. This foundation has solidified my leadership skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving. At EMCOR Facilities Services, where I served as a Project Manager Co-op on the Transition Team, I learned to collaborate amongst departments, interact with customers, and to process vast amounts of data. While I wasn't coding in this role, I learned non-technical skills like teamwork, adaptability, and organization and will be crucial in offsetting responsibilities with my teammate and advisor.
These two experiences taught me how to keep a functioning team up and running and how to treat individual data carefully and I will be implementing these skills directly in how I will be taking care of backend database of NARLA and keeping the app user-friendly.

The best part about this is likely the fact that it is directly an idea based on issues we face in real life as student roommates. Every other day we are faced with issues of dividing the bills, keeping track of the groceries, and so on and sometimes these chores will bring unwarranted tension. That is why I am very interested in developing this app, because it has the potential to address problems that I personally relate to. Since Aditya and I are roommates too and two others become part of our household too, we will be able to bring our real-world experiences and design features that will actually be of use in student flats. This is exciting to me because it will mean the app will be not just a school exercise but will in itself be something to alleviate our daily life hassles and potentially others like us. My motivation is also the fact that this is a chance to bring together technical areas of interest in SQL and Python and real-world problem-solving and so it is particularly special to me.

Our first plan is to start small and to design solutions based on what is best suited to us in our own apartment. We will first look to implement the essential features such as bill-splitting, allocating chores, and inventory trackingâ€”before we tackle the predictive features and add-on hardware. At the conclusion of it all, our hope is to have a full-featured app in existence to present roommates with an easier time cohabiting and to forego typical disputes. The app should minimize time on trivialities, avoid misunderstandings, and make it so very easy to coordinate mutual responsibilities. If it is a hit, I'd like to even go a step further and publish it so other students may be able to derive some benefits from it. As an initiative to measure my contributions, I will try the app amongst my three roommates and track how it performs in our daily life. If it runs successfully and treats the very same problems we are confronted with then I will be able to say I've done an excellent job, and if it doesn't then I will review and correct the defects in the solution until it is effective.
