# User Stories

1. As a roommate, I want to see a shared dashboard of chores, bills, and inventory so that responsibilities and expenses are transparent and easy to track.

2. As the primary bill payer, I want to scan receipts and have costs split automatically so that I can quickly settle balances without manual calculations.

3. As a busy student, I want to receive AI-driven reminders for chores, groceries, and payments so that I stay organized and avoid last-minute stress.

4. As a new roommate, I want a simple onboarding checklist to set my preferences (diet, cleaning frequency, budgets) so that the app personalizes tasks from the start.

5. As a household, we want chores to be assigned and rotated fairly with reminders so that conflicts are reduced and tasks are completed on time.
