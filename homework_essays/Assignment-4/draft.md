---

As a roommate, I want to see a clear, shared list of chores with due dates and owners, so that responsibilities are transparent and nothing is forgotten.

As the primary bill payer, I want to scan a grocery or utility receipt and have the app split costs automatically, so that I can settle up with roommates quickly and fairly.

As a busy student, I want the app to remind me when it’s my turn for a task and nudge me before due dates, so that I stay on top of chores without stressing.

As a new roommate joining mid‑semester, I want an onboarding checklist that sets my preferences (diet, cleaning frequency, budgets), so that the app personalizes tasks and splits from day one.

As a household, we want a shared dashboard showing recent expenses, upcoming chores, and who owes whom, so that we can avoid awkward conversations and keep the apartment running smoothly.
