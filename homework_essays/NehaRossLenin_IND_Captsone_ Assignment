# Part #2: Individual Capstone Assessment

I am super excited to work on our senior design project, which is focused on building a mobile app that helps simplify shared apartment living. From my perspective, this is the perfect project because it gives me the chance to combine creativity with real technical skills. The part I am looking forward to the most is applying my knowledge of SQL and Python, my two favorite programming languages. With SQL, I will design and manage the database that stores important details like groceries, bills, and chores, while Python will handle the logic and automation features of the app. I think it will be exciting to see how these pieces come together into one system that actually solves a problem students face every day. Overall, this project feels like the ideal opportunity to showcase what I’ve learned in my classes and turn it into something practical and impactful.

My college curriculum has given me a strong foundation that I will directly apply to our senior design project. Courses like CS4092: Database Design and Development have been the most useful for preparing me to work on the SQL portion of the app, since I gained hands-on experience building relational databases and designing ER models. CS2023: Python Programming was one of the first courses I took, and while it was a basic introduction, it gave me essential practice using Anaconda, Pandas, and the fundamentals of coding in Python. I also benefited from EECE3093C: Software Engineering, where I worked on group projects and learned how to approach software development in a structured, collaborative way. EECE4029: Operating Systems and Systems Programming taught me the importance of efficiency, resource management, and debugging, which I can apply when making sure the app runs smoothly. Finally, CS4033: Artificial Intelligence prepared me to contribute to the predictive algorithms that will make our app stand out. Altogether, these courses provided me with both technical and problem-solving skills that we can now channel into building NARLA.

My co-op and work experiences have also shaped how I will approach this project, even when the work itself was not strictly technical. At EMCOR Facilities Services, where I was a Project Manager Co-op on the Transition Team, I learned how to collaborate across departments, communicate with clients, and manage large amounts of data. While I was not coding in this role, I gained valuable non-technical skills such as teamwork, adaptability, and organization, all of which will be important when balancing responsibilities with my teammate and advisor. At UC Parking Services, where I currently serve as a Lead Student Worker, I have had the opportunity to supervise other student workers, resolve technical issues with parking equipment, and work with large amounts of data in Excel. This role has strengthened my leadership skills, attention to detail, and ability to troubleshoot problems effectively. Both experiences taught me how to keep teams running smoothly and how to handle data with care, which will directly support my role in managing NARLA’s backend database and ensuring the app remains user-friendly.

I think the best part about this project is that the idea comes directly from the challenges we face in real life as students living with roommates. Every day we deal with things like splitting bills, keeping track of groceries, and organizing chores, and sometimes those tasks can cause unnecessary tension. That is why I am especially motivated to build this app, because it has the potential to solve problems that I personally relate to. Since Aditya and I are roommates ourselves, along with two others, we will be able to bring in our real experiences and design features that truly make sense for student apartments. I find this exciting because it means the app will not just be a school project but something that has the potential to make daily life easier for us and others in similar situations. My motivation also comes from knowing that this project combines my technical interests in SQL and Python with real-world problem-solving, which makes it even more meaningful to me.

Our preliminary approach is to start small and design solutions based on what works best for us in our own apartment. We plan to focus first on the core features—such as bill splitting, chore management, and inventory tracking—before expanding into predictive features and optional hardware. By the time we finish, our goal is to deliver a fully functional app that allows roommates to live together more smoothly and avoid common conflicts. We want the app to save time, prevent confusion, and make managing shared responsibilities much easier. If it works well, I would love to even take it further and publish it so that other students can benefit. To evaluate my contributions, I will test the app with my three roommates and see how it performs in our daily lives. If it runs smoothly and solves the very problems we deal with, then I will know I have done a good job, and if not, I will identify those weaknesses and improve the solution until it works.
